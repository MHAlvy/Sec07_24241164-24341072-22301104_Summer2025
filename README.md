     Project Idea:  Spaceship Dodger 3D

Game Features and Functionality

1. Full 3D Spaceship Movement and Control
Complete implementation of smooth player-controlled spaceship navigation in 3D: forward/back, left/right, and up/down.
Includes acceleration, deceleration, and momentum for realism.
Keyboard or mouse support for real-time responsiveness.

2. Multiple Obstacle Types and Patterns
Diverse 3D obstacles (like asteroids, debris fields, moving barriers) with unique movement behaviors (like linear motion, rotation, zig-zag, expanding/contracting).
Each obstacle type is handled with its own logic and Collision Boundaries.

3. Collision Detection System (Player/Obstacle)
Robust collision handling using bounding spheres/boxes for the spaceship and obstacles.
Handles consequences: triggers explosion sequences, deducts health or lives, or causes game over.
Visual feedback (like color flash, shake, or animation) on collision using only template rendering methods.

4. Dynamic Difficulty Scaling (Game Progression)
Game increases in speed, obstacle density, pattern complexity, or game area size as the player survives longer or reaches milestones.
Supports continuous (like endless mode) or level-based advancement.

5. Camera System: Multiple Perspectives
Switch between TPS/third-person (behind the ship) and FPS/first-person (cockpit) camera views during gameplay with a key press.
Camera follows and smoothly interpolates with the ship, optionally with dynamic FOV for speed effects, all with template transformation/matrix code.

6. Checkpoint/Zone/Level System
The game is divided into distinct zones or levels, each introducing new background, obstacle sets, or visual style changes (such as nebulae, tunnels, planets, all drawn using basic 3D geometric primitives).
Includes checkpoints for Respawn or Bonus Points.

7.Shield/Lives System
Spaceship has a shield meter, or fixed lives visible on screen.
Collisions reduce health/shield; shields recharge over time or by picking up objects.

8. High Score/Leaderboard System
Display and update the highest scores achieved on the current run or all time.
Includes scorekeeping based on distance, obstacles dodged, and time survived.

9. Game State Management (Menus, Pause, Restart, Game Over)
Include full in-game menus: main menu, pause, game over, and settings.
Implement functional state changes (pausing animation, restarting game, returning to menu).



10 . Custom Digital Line Rendering System
Draw laser beams, wireframes (spaceship outlines, obstacles), bullet trails, predictive paths, or special “shatter” effects on collision.



11. Power-ups and Cheat Modes
Create and integrate power-ups (like temporary shield, speed boost, slow motion, or invulnerability/cheat mode).
Handle their spawning, collection, visual feedback, and effects on gameplay.

12. Trail and Ghost System
Draw a fading trail behind the spaceship (e.g., with points, lines). Optionally, show a “ghost” path from the previous run to challenge improvement.
